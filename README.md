**Real-Time Gesture Recognizer**

**Overview**

The Real-Time Gesture Recognizer is a computer vision application that uses OpenCV and deep learning techniques to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time. This project aims to create an intuitive interface for applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, gaming, and assistive technology.

**Features**

1. Real-time gesture recognition using webcam input
2. Customizable gesture training with a user-friendly interface
3. Lightweight and efficient for real-time performance

**Requirements**

1. Python 3.12 or higher
2. OpenCV
3. NumPy
4. Sklearn
5. TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your model)

**Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/20240290/real_time_hand_gesture_recognizer.git

cd gesture-recognizer

**Usage**

1. Run the main application:
    python main.py

2. Please choose from the following options: 

    1. Capture data set. 
    2. Train the data set. 
    3. Recognize the gesture.
    4. Clear dataset.
    5. End the program.
Note: Best option to clear the dataset if you want to start collecting new set of images.
Then select the item 1 in the menu to capture the dataset of gestures.

2. Training Custom Gestures by selecting 2 in the menu item.
3. Then select menu item 3 to start the gesture recognition.
