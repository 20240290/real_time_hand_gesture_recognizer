Real-Time Gesture Recognizer

Overview

The Real-Time Gesture Recognizer is a computer vision application that uses OpenCV and deep learning techniques to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time. This project aims to create an intuitive interface for applications in fields such as human-computer interaction, gaming, and assistive technology.

Features

• Real-time gesture recognition using webcam input
• Customizable gesture training with a user-friendly interface
• Lightweight and efficient for real-time performance

Requirements

• Python 3.12 or higher
• OpenCV
• NumPy
• TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, depending on your model)

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/20240290/real_time_hand_gesture_recognizer.git
cd gesture-recognizer

Usage

1. Run the main application:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to start recognizing gestures.

2. Please choose from the following options: 

    1. Capture data set. 
    2. Train the data set. 
    3. Recognize the gesture.
    4. Clear dataset.
    5. End the program.

Note: Best option to clear the dataset if you want to start collecting new set of iamges. 
      Then select the item 1 in the menu to capture the dataset of gestures.

2. Training Custom Gestures by selecting 2 in the menu item.
3. Then select menu item 3 to start the gesture recognition.
